This notes will save your time :)

Strings:
- while working on string interpolation, you need to
    use strings with backstick(`) not with ' or ".
- Backticks allow you to create multi-line strings without the need for escape characters or concatenation.
    This is especially helpful when writing long strings, such as HTML templates, SQL queries, or JSON objects.

Functions: 
- we need to declare the return type of Function while defining Functions.
